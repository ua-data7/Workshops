Foreword
=========

   The **tRIBS (TIN-based Real-Time Integrated Basin Simulator)
   Distributed Hydrologic Model** is a set of object-oriented,
   *C++* programs that allow for the construction and simulation
   of catchment scale hydrologic processes on a *Triangulated
   Irregular Network (TIN)*. The development of the tRIBS Model
   has been the result of hydrologic modeling and software
   development efforts performed by various researchers in the
   Ralph M. Parsons Laboratory in the Department of Civil and
   Environmental Engineering of the Massachusetts Institute of
   Technology. Model development continues at MIT and New Mexico Tech,
   among other partnering institutions. This document is intended
   to serve as a user manual for the tRIBS Model, including instructions
   on how to download, compile, set up and run tRIBS. In addition,
   an effort has been made to document the model software design using
   class and workflow diagrams. This guide assumes that the reader is
   familiar with the capabilities of the tRIBS Model and its intended
   purposes. More information concerning the model can be obtained
   through the tRIBS Research Description and Publication List.
   Additional instructions regarding the Mesh Generation can be
   found in the CHILD Model User Manual. tRIBS is copyrighted
