Introduction
==================

    A number of physically-based, distributed hydrologic models of varying degrees of complexity have been developed for the purpose of flood prediction. Physically-based models solve parameterized equations for fluid flow in the land components of the hydrologic cycle, rather than using the calibration approach of conceptual models. Distributed models try to resolve these physical processes in both space and time, leading to the implementation of numeric codes. Most physically-based, distributed models, however, tend to be so complex that execution times are prohibitively large. This drawback diminishes the capacity for model calibration and validation and eliminates the possibility for ensemble averaging or probabilistic forecasting. One of the major factors leading to the large execution times is the inefficiency in the representation of terrain inherent in a raster grid, the preferred mesh structure in most commercial or research-based distributed hydrologic models. This document elaborates on the use and application of a new distributed model that attempts to bypass many of the current difficulties by representing the terrain through triangulated irregular networks (TINs).

    The TIN-based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) is a collection of C++ classes designed for distributed hydrologic modeling at small to mid-size catchment scales. The object-oriented software design offers several advantages over traditional procedural programming. In particular, by grouping data and functions operating on these variables into distinct classes, it becomes possible to separate the various hydrologic processes operating on the TIN mesh from the procedures for creating the mesh itself (Tucker *et. al*, 2001) [Tucker_2001]_. The object-oriented approach also allows for code modularity in such a way as to facilitate model development through code reuse and integration or substitution of new process modules. Such a strategy permitted the development of the tRIBS model from the CHILD modeling framework (Tucker *et. al*, 1999) [Tucker_1999a]_ within a reasonable amount of time and effort. Hydrologic modules from the RIBS model (Garrote and Bras, 1995) [Garrote_Bras_1995a]_ and new hydrologic process models were incorporated into the CHILD framework as separate classes. In addition, the modularity allows for the integration of additional process modules and the potential for finite element modeling (FEM) within the existing mesh architecture.

    The tRIBS User Manual is intended to serve as an introduction for new users to the TIN-based distributed hydrologic model. It will cover several topic areas relating to the design, setup, execution and proper usage of the model, in addition to discussing certain limitations and potential future improvements. An exhaustive explanation of each topic area is avoided to maintain this document as a short reference manual. tRIBS is currently a hydrologic research model and is not intended for commercial use and/or professional practice. As a research tool, tRIBS does relatively little error checking to ensure that all the input files are properly constructed. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the input file formats are correct and that parameter values are reasonable. This document provides sufficient information for the proper construction and execution of tRIBS. Further questions should be addressed to the authors or found in the various publications.
